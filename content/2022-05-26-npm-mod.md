> This is cross-posted from the Hardfin engineering [blog][16].

As programming language ecosystems evolve, they learn from each other. When this
happens we all benefit from more useful features, patterns, libraries, and
tools. A core part of a programming language ecosystem &mdash; packaging &mdash;
can be a source of pain, e.g. from version [conflicts][1], slow [build][2]
times, security [issues][3], etc.

At Hardfin we are happy users of both Go and TypeScript. We love the wealth of
useful packages in the `npm` ecosystem that help us build modern web
applications. There are a few common patterns in the Go packaging landscape that
don't translate to the `npm` packaging experience, but we would love it if they
did! In this post we'll introduce a tool that exemplifies language ecosystem
cross pollination. This tool is a minimal implementation of an experiment to
bring the benefits of Go package vendoring to the `npm` ecosystem.

## Stuck on an airplane

Alice is scrambling to leave her apartment for a flight that takes off in less
than an hour. She wants to get familiar with the application her new team
maintains, so she clones the repo in a hurry before packing her laptop. In a mad
dash she **just** manages to board the plane before the gate closes. Finally
with a chance to collect herself and breathe, she opens her laptop and gets
ready to start coding.

After reading the team's getting started document, she hops into the backend
code and fires up the server:

```bash
go run ./cmd/feather-server/main.go
```

Now that the backend is running, she moves on to the frontend instructions in
the getting started document. Unfortunately, this is a roadblock that she'll
need inflight Wi-Fi to overcome. To build and run the frontend, she first
needs to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
npm run feather-app
```

Meanwhile on the ground, Alice's new teammates Eve and Trudy are struggling to
understand why the frontend build caused the latest production deploy to fail.
It's very unfortunate timing &mdash; they are trying to ship a new feature as
part of a customer demo.

There were no signs of trouble in the latest merged pull request; all CI checks
passed. But the build is failing to install dependencies with:

```bash
$ npm ci
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/skugga/-/skugga-9.1.1.tgz - Not found
npm ERR! 404
npm ERR! 404  'skugga@https://registry.npmjs.org/skugga/-/skugga-9.1.1.tgz' is not in this registry.
npm ERR! 404
npm ERR! 404 Note that you can also install from a
npm ERR! 404 tarball, folder, http url, or git url.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /root/.npm/_logs/2022-04-29T16_20_17_523Z-debug-0.log
```

After 30 minutes of scrambling and head scratching, they hop on Twitter and from
reading posts in their timeline they realize the author of `skugga` has removed
the package entirely from the package registry.

## Why airplane mode for dependencies?

Why was Alice able to start the Go backend after **only** just cloning the
repository? Her team [uses][4] `go mod vendor` and checks in the root
`vendor/` directory to the codebase. This means that after `git clone`, all
application binaries can be built by the Go compiler &mdash; no dependencies to
fetch, no inflight Wi-Fi necessary! In addition to enabling airplane mode,
there are several other benefits[ref]The primary [downside][14] of checking in
`vendor/` is a larger `git` checkout.[/ref] from checking in the `vendor/`
directory:

- New dependencies show up in pull requests as changes to `vendor/`; the
  larger the diff, the more "weight" that the dependency adds
- All builds (Docker and otherwise) are hermetic and don't require
  fetching packages from the public internet[ref]**Mostly** hermetic. This
  really only applies to the components of the build containing Go or
  TypeScript code (and packages).[/ref]
- Even if dependencies are [deleted][5] by a third party, this won't impact
  the current codebase (avoiding the
  "my code didn't change but it stopped working!" crisis that Eve and Trudy
  are in)
- Fully consistent development environments for all team members (without
  need for consistent `~/.npm/_cacache`, `~/Library/Caches/Yarn/v6`, etc.)
- Supply chain [attacks][15] cannot impact the dependencies without making it
  into a pull request

## Switching `npm` into airplane mode

In order to bring the `go mod vendor` experience to the `npm` ecosystem, we've
created an experimental CLI [tool][6] called `npm-mod`. Using the tool, Alice
can download all package tarballs into the `vendor/` directory and change the
application's `package.json` and `package-lock.json` so that all **remote**
package references are replaced with local file references.

```bash
$ npm-mod tidy
$ npm-mod vendor
Saved babel__helper-builder-binary-assignment-operator-visitor-7.16.7.tgz
Saved babel__generator-7.17.9.tgz
...
$
$ ls -1 vendor/
abab-2.0.6.tgz
...
$ ls -1 vendor/ | wc -l
    1135
```

After running this, both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` will be
changed and a new `.npm-mod.tidy.json` file will be added:

```diff
diff --git a/package-lock.json b/package-lock.json

## The next flight: future work

After doing this, Alice can happily install all of the `npm` packages for her
team's application without any internet connection:

```bash
$ ping hardfin.com
ping: cannot resolve hardfin.com: Unknown host
$
$ time npm ci
...

added 1393 packages, and audited 1394 packages in 4s

...

real    0m4.456s
user    0m5.112s
sys     0m5.802s
```

This is still an experiment and we'd want to see some improvements before
recommending `npm-mod` as a core part of your team's workflow:

- This tool is intended for **applications**, it should not be used for a
  library published to a package registry.
- The vendoring process should hook into `npm audit` ([problems][9] with
  `npm audit` notwithstanding).
- The existence of `npm` install scripts still poses a large security
  concern. There is a growing [movement][11] to disable install scripts.
- Though the `vendor/` approach mitigates supply chain "denial of service"
  attacks like the `colors` [incident][10], actually **catching** instances
  of this during code review is still a challenge if the only artifacts
  checked into the `vendor/` directory are tarballs.
- There is no `npm` equivalent of the Go build cache (`go env GOCACHE`);
  if the same Go package is built multiple times, the previous builds can
  be reused. The nearest equivalent is the presence of the same
  (already installed) package in `node_modules/`.

## Landing the plane

We'd love to continue the [discussion][13] and improve `npm-mod` to a point
where teams like Alice's and our own are comfortable using it in daily
workflows. By adopting this workflow and gaining airplane mode, teams can
avoid unexpected breakages and ensure **all** code required to build the
repo is present after checkout.

In addition to the tooling, there is a cultural norm in the Go community
of viewing new dependencies with skepticism. This is captured by a
[Go proverb][12]: A little copying is better than a little dependency.
Checking application dependencies into the codebase means they are front
and center, both for security and for their contents. In addition to enabling
airplane mode, we hope that by vendoring the [weight][8] of dependencies starts
to get more consideration.
