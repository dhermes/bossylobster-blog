**Drop dead millenials**! I live in Silicon Valley and even can **program a
computer**, and I want millenials to drop dead. Except of course those
millenials in my secret cabal out here in California. (As this is written
I am 26, which makes me squarely a millenial.)

This is the thesis of a recent CNN.com [article][1] by journalism
[professor][5] [@David_R_Wheeler][2]. Taking his cue, I have used the same
attention grabbing title.

Before diving in, a rundown of David's key points:

- Silicon Valley [destroying jobs][6] is the same thing as Wall Street
  abusing Middle America by taking Grandma's pension
- Hard work and education leads to a job for a young person
- The fictional [Gryzzl][3] is an exemplar of real life tech titans
- The digital economy is supposed to lead to better jobs for the
  educated
- A future with no jobs for "people of ordinary talents" must be dystopian

I'll try to address and refute these in short order without letting my
biases leak in too much.

Wheeler makes **plenty of good points**, they are just scattered in between
a minefield of bad logic, no data and non-sequitur conclusions.

## Silicon Valley is Wall Street {#sv-is-wall-street}

> We have no problem taking Wall Street executives to task for decisions
> that leave American families financially devastated, yet we give Silicon
> Valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing.

What does **the same thing** mean? The closest David ever comes to
attempting this is calling out the sharing economy and Amazon's
warehouses.

This [FUD][8]-induced claim doesn't really stack up. We take Wall Street
to task [because][9]

> Banks broke the financial system taking on excessive risk and received a
> taxpayer-funded bailout

and because when politicians get in bed with banks, bad things happen:

> The Fed's interest rate policy is forcing "grandma to subsidize Goldman"

We cringe when Goldman bankers [admit][10] to selling toxic securities to
"widows and orphans".

## Education is a Free Pass {#education-free-pass}

By comparing numbers from the early '90s to today, Wheeler concludes:

> Those with a bachelor's diploma were better off before the
> digital revolution

as if the only thing that occurred in that window was the internet revolution.

</style>

In addition, [levels][11] of education [rose][12]:

<div class="blog">
  <div class="nobrtable">
    <table class="blog">
    <tbody>
      <tr class="header">
        <th>Education</th>
        <th>High School</th>
        <th>Bachelor's</th>
      </tr>
      <tr class="alt">
        <td>1980</td>
        <td align="right">69.7%</td>
        <td align="right">17.1%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1990</td>
        <td align="right">75.2%</td>
        <td align="right">20.3%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="alt">
        <td>2000</td>
        <td align="right">80.4%</td>
        <td align="right">24.4%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2009</td>
        <td align="right">85.3%</td>
        <td align="right">27.9%</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

This means that a random person on the street is much more likely
to have a college degree, and by that same token much less likely
to stand out with that degree.

It's easier to conclude that the low-quality jobs available to
young college graduates is due to **credential saturation**. Instead
of assuming that Silicon Valley has destroyed or devalued jobs for
young people, it's the over-credentialing of our population that
has reduced the value of the shared college experience. The college degree
has become what the high school diploma was: a minimum barrier to
entry. (I have lots of thoughts on this, but will hold them for
another post.)

In this context, it becomes relevant to differentiate by developing
real skills. This is territory where **Wheeler might have a leg to
stand on**, if he knew he had legs. In our current state, we witness
a [skills mismatch][13]:

> Shortages of qualified workers have been especially severe in science,
> technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

This is the result of Silicon Valley creating demand for tech workers
and (potentially) reducing availability of jobs outside the tech sector.
(I haven't tried to find numbers here to support Wheeler's thesis, that
was his job.)

What's the alternative? Should we discourage innovations that increase
productivity and in the process reduce demand for labor? Should we artifically
supply jobs that are no longer needed?

**There is no free pass.** When Wheeler says

> The commonly held belief is that with hard work and a good education, a
> young person in America can get a good job.

he is right. This is the commonly held belief, but it is incorrect. Hard work
is increasingly less useful when said young person doesn't develop skills
that the labor market values.

## Gryzzl is Silicon Valley {#gryzzl}

First, let me say I agree with the general idea that the Parks and
Recreation writers pegged Silicon Valley pretty well with their
Gryzzl caricature.

For example, this short showcases the public's growing privacy concerns
while also capturing the potential perks a company could deliver with
private data:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KX4JErnGUlE?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, using a caricature to make **real points** about the **real world**
is equally cartoonish.

## Digital Economy is a Job Creator {#digital-econ-jobs}

Former secretary of labor Robert Reich [says][7]:

> That doesnâ€™t make the opportunity a great deal. It only shows how bad a
> deal most working people have otherwise been getting.

## No Jobs is No Good {#no-jobs-no-fun}
