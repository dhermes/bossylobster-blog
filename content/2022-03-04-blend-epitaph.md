### Goodbye

I recently made the **very hard** decision to leave [Blend][1]. Today
(March 4, 2022) is my last day. I am overwhelmed with emotion thinking about
all of the amazing people I worked with and projects I worked on at Blend.
I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, it has meant the world
to me.

After finishing my PhD I had a standing job offer to return to Google, but
decided to take a leap at Blend and learn something new. Boy did I ever! I
spent just over three years at Blend but I feel like by moving at startup speed
I gained ten years of indispensable experience.

I've seen the incredible impact that comes from meeting a customer need. In
my early time here on a product team, we saw a quarter's worth of effort turn
into huge increases in utilization for our target customers.

I've directly witnessed the growing pains that come with hockey stick growth
and the heroic efforts to scale systems, databases and people. Hearing
motivational speeches from our leaders is one thing, but watching the scale of
our compute grow as our product continued to gain traction was the most
motivating thing of all for me[ref]Especially when followed by talks from
finance showing revenue growth that tracked the growth in compute.[/ref]!

Though it is already a publicly traded, multibillion dollar company, Blend
is still a very young company. That means everyone still gets the chance to
influence the culture at Blend and set the standards in Blend engineering for
the future. This was and is incredibly compelling to me[ref]Each of
the teammates that I've helped hire can attest that I make this pitch during
the interview process.[/ref]!

### What's Next?

I am not running away from Blend, I am running towards a new opportunity. I
am starting a company with two close friends. I have been fascinated with
company building since early in my career and am excited to begin the journey
of growing my very own startup.

### So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
