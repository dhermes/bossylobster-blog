This is from a talk I gave to the [UC Santa Cruz
Math](http://www.math.ucsc.edu/) Club back in February. I have had the
slides [cluttering my
desk](http://brucefong.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/cluttered_desk.jpg)
since I gave the talk as a reminder of putting them up on the web, and
today I finally cleaned them off!   
  
An interested tidbit about these slides: I gave the [same
talk](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathclub/fall2008/103008.pdf) one
other time as an
[undergraduate](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathclub/). As an
undergraduate I gave the talk the day after a root canal. This February
(at UCSC), one day after the talk I also had a root canal. What's the
moral of the story? Don't give this talk.   
  
No seriously, don't give this talk. Though the fact is cool and the math
is not too bad to grasp, the stuff from slides 106 to 113 goes way over
an audience's collective head just because they have [stopped paying
attention](http://ellay2013.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/sleeping_in_class.jpg)
at that point. Too many variables!
