This is from a talk I gave to the
[UC Santa Cruz Math](http://www.math.ucsc.edu/) Club back in February.
I have had the slides
[cluttering my desk](/images/cluttered_desk.jpg)
since I gave the talk as a reminder of putting them up on the web, and
today I finally cleaned them off!

An interested tidbit about these slides: I gave the
[same talk](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathclub/fall2008/103008.pdf) one
other time as an
[undergraduate](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathclub/). As an
undergraduate I gave the talk the day after a root canal. This February
(at UCSC), one day after the talk I also had a root canal. What's the
moral of the story? Don't give this talk.

No seriously, don't give this talk. Though the fact is cool and the math
is not too bad to grasp, the stuff from slides 106 to 113 goes way over
an audience's collective head just because they have
[stopped paying attention](/images/sleeping_in_class.jpg)
at that point. Too many variables!
