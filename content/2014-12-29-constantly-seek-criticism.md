My mother often reminds me that I am wrong. She points out that from her
perspective, it appears I believe myself to be incapable of being wrong.

Personal infallibility aside, this continued interaction with my mother
has a broader takeaway. The most salient piece of wisdom imparted is that
I am seldom 100% right about things, and in fact am seldom 50% right about
things.

It is crucial to have people in our lives to remind us when our ideas are
broken, to call us out when we overstep, or to pull us down to earth when
our aspirations are not rooted on this earth.

Though I chose my mother's persistence to illustrate this reality, it was
a cousin and mentor who actually explained the phenonemon to me back
in 2012.

This fact is not lost on [Elon Musk][1]. Elon is admirable both as an
entrepreneur and as a scientist. He derives much of his success from

- Dogged persistence in pursuit of his goals and in the face of failure
- Unparalleled clarity of thought and conviction in his ideas
- Constant preparation in both business and science hard-won through
  years of labor

But this man, more prepared than many (than any?) on this earth to
tackle such grand challenges, still **seeks out criticism**:
