My mother often reminds me that I am wrong. She points out that from her
perspective, it appears I believe myself to be incapable of being wrong.

Personal infallibility aside, this routine interaction with my mother
has a broader takeaway. It is crucial to have people in our lives to remind
us when our ideas are broken, to call us out when we overstep, or to pull us
down to earth when our aspirations are not rooted here.

This fact is not lost on [Elon Musk][1] &mdash; who inspired this
post and even coined the title. Many close to me can attest that I greatly
admire Elon both as an entrepreneur and as a scientist. He has proven as a
founder of PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla that his talent, technical breadth,
and sheer persistence are unparalleled.

But this man &mdash; more prepared than many (than any?) on this earth to
tackle such grand challenges &mdash; still **seeks out criticism**:
