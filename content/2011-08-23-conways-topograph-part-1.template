This is the first in a series of three blog posts. In the following
we'll investigate a few properties of an object called Conway's
topograph. [John Conway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway)
conjured up a way to understand a binary quadratic form &ndash; a very important
algebraic object &ndash; in a geometric context. This is by no means original
work, just my interpretation of some key points from his

that I'll need for some other posts.

#### Definition: {{ "{#define-quadratic-form}" }}

A binary quadratic form {{ get_latex_img("f") }} is an equation of
the form:

{{ get_latex_img("f(x, y) = A x^2 + H x y + B y^2.", blockquote=True) }}

That is, a function of two variables which is homogeneous of degree two.
The coefficients {{ get_latex_img("A") }}, {{ get_latex_img("H") }}, and
{{ get_latex_img("B") }} and variables {{ get_latex_img("x") }} and
{{ get_latex_img("y") }} are often real numbers, rational numbers or integers.
{{ get_latex_img("\\blacksquare") }}

When we require the coefficients {{ get_latex_img("A") }}, {{ get_latex_img("H") }}, and
{{ get_latex_img("B") }} as well as the variables {{ get_latex_img("x, y") }} to be
integers, we get an integer-valued form. In his **Disquisitiones Arithmeticae**,
Gauss asked (and largely answered) the fundamental question: what
integer values can each form take? For example, you may have seen the
form

{{ get_latex_img("f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2,", blockquote=True) }}

where it was determined that the only primes (Gaussian primes) occuring were
{{ get_latex_img("2") }} and those odd primes congruent to 1 modulo 4.

As each form {{ get_latex_img("f") }} is homogenous degree two,
{{ get_latex_img("f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^2 f(x, y)") }}. As a result,
if we can understand the values of {{ get_latex_img("f") }} for pairs
{{ get_latex_img("(x, y)") }} which don't share any factors, we can understand the
entire set of values that {{ get_latex_img("f") }} takes. Also, letting
{{ get_latex_img("\\lambda = -1") }}, there is no change in the value of
{{ get_latex_img("f") }} since {{ get_latex_img("\\lambda^2 = 1") }}, hence it suffices
to think of {{ get_latex_img("v = (x, y)") }} as {{ get_latex_img("\\pm v") }}, i.e.
{{ get_latex_img("\\left\\{(x, y), (-x, -y)\\right\\}") }}.

For integers {{ get_latex_img("x") }} and {{ get_latex_img("y") }}, any point
{{ get_latex_img("(x, y)") }} can be expressed as an integral linear combination of
the vectors {{ get_latex_img("e_1 = (1, 0)") }} and
{{ get_latex_img("e_2 = (0, 1)") }}. So if we like, we can express all relevant
inputs for {{ get_latex_img("f") }} in terms of two vectors. However, instead
considering {{ get_latex_img("e_2 = (1, 1)") }}, we have

{{ get_latex_img("(x - y) \\cdot e_1 + y \\cdot e_2 = (x, y)", blockquote=True) }}

and realize a different pair {{ get_latex_img("e_1, e_2") }} which again yield all
possible integer valued vectors as integral linear combinations.

#### Definition: {{ "{#define-base}" }}

A **strict base** is an ordered pair {{ get_latex_img("(e_1, e_2)") }} whose
integral linear combinations are exactly all vectors with integer coordinates.
A **lax base** is a set {{ get_latex_img("\\left\\{\\pm e_1, \\pm e_2\\right\\}") }}
obtained from a strict base.
{{ get_latex_img("\\blacksquare") }}

#### Definition: {{ "{#define-superbase}" }}

A **strict superbase** is an ordered triple {{ get_latex_img("(e_1, e_2, e_3)") }},
for which {{ get_latex_img("e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = (0, 0)") }} and
{{ get_latex_img("(e_1, e_2)") }} is a strict base (i.e., with strict vectors), and
a **lax superbase** is a set
{{ get_latex_img("\\langle\\pm e_1, \\pm e_2, \\pm e_3\\rangle") }} where
{{ get_latex_img("(e_1, e_2, e_3)") }} is a strict superbase.
{{ get_latex_img("\\blacksquare") }}

For our (and Conway's) purposes, it is useful to consider the lax notions and
leave the strict notions as an afterthought since a binary quadratic form is
unchanged given a sign change. From here forward, for a vector
{{ get_latex_img("v") }}, we use the notation {{ get_latex_img("v") }} interchangeably
with {{ get_latex_img("\\pm v") }} and when referring to a base/superbase, we are
referring to the lax equivalent of these notions.

#### Update:

This material is intentionally aimed at an intermediate (think college
freshman/high school senior) audience. One can go deeper with it, and I'd
love to get more technical off the post.
