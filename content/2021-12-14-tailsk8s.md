For my most recent side project `tailsk8s`, I've been [hacking][1] on a
bare metal Kubernetes cluster that uses [Tailscale][2] for networking.
I had a lot of fun and learned a lot, but the TL;DR is that each Kubernetes
node is a Tailscale [subnet router][3] and uses the `kubenet` [CNI][4] to
indicate the relevant subnet to the rest of the cluster.

To demonstrate the process of bringing up the cluster and to see the
networking in action I recorded two videos. The first one involves only
the four[ref]The four node cluster also has two control plane nodes because
I don't have enough machines. Luckily I don't mind if they can't form a
quorum.[/ref] bare metal nodes that I literally have in my house. The second
video turns it into a hybrid cluster by adding an AWS EC2 VM and a GCP GCE
instance.
