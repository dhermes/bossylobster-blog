by [Daniel Kahneman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman).
(Thanks to Elianna for letting me borrow it.) I'm not finished yet, but
60% of the way through I definitely recommend it.

While reading the "Causes Trump Statistics" chapter (number 16), there
is a description of a study about cabs and hit-and-run accidents. It
describes a scenario where participants are told that 85% of cabs are
Green, 15% are Blue and a given observer has an 80% chance of correctly
identifying the color of a given cab. Given this data, the chapter
presents a scenario where a bystander identifies a cab in an accident as
Blue and Kahneman goes on to explain how we fail to take the data into
consideration. I really enjoyed this chapter, but won't wreck the book
for you.

Instead, I want to do some math (big surprise, I know). However, I want
to make it accessible to non-mathematicians (atypical for my posts).

Given the data, Kahneman tells us that the true probability that the cab
was Blue is 41% though we likely bias our thinking towards the 80%
probability of the identification being correct. I was on the
[bus](http://www.sfmta.com/) and it kept bothering me, to the point that
I couldn't continue reading. Eventually I figured it out (when I got to
the [train](http://www.bart.gov/)) and I wanted to explain how this is
computed using [Bayes' Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_law).
As a primer, I wrote a
[post](/2014/07/bayes-law-primer.html) using
layman's terms explaining how we use Bayes' Law. (There is some notation
introduced but I hope it isn't too confusing.)

Putting Bayes' Law to Use
-------------------------

We need to understand what 41% even corresponds to before we can compute
it. What's actually happened is that we know the event
{{ get_latex_img("IDB") }} has occurred -- the cab has been identified
({{ get_latex_img("ID") }}) as Blue ({{ get_latex_img("B") }}).
What we want is the probability that the cab **is Blue** given we know
it has been identified -- we want:

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(B \\, | \\, IDB).", blockquote=True) }}

Using Bayes' Law, we can write

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(B \\, | \\, IDB) = \\frac{\\text{Pr}(B \\text{ and } IDB \\text{ both occur})}{\\text{Pr}(IDB)}", blockquote=True) }}

and

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, B) = \\frac{\\text{Pr}(B \\text{ and } IDB \\text{ both occur})}{\\text{Pr}(B)}.", blockquote=True) }}

identified 80% of the time hence

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, B) = 0.8", blockquote=True) }}

(i.e. the probability of correct ID
as Blue given it is actually Blue). We're also told that 15% of the cabs
are Blue hence

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(B) = 0.15.", blockquote=True) }}

 We can combine these with the second
application of Bayes' Law above to show that

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(B \\text{ and } IDB \\text{ both occur}) = \\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, B) \\cdot \\text{Pr}(B) = 0.12.", blockquote=True) }}

The only piece of data missing now to finish our computation is
{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB)") }}.

Using the
[extended form](ster.com/2014/07/bayes-law-primer.html#extended)
of Bayes' Law, since we know that the events {{ get_latex_img("B") }} and
{{ get_latex_img("G") }} (the cab is Blue or Green) are exclusive and cover all
possibilities for the cab, we can say that

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB) = \\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, B) \\cdot \\text{Pr}(B) + \\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, G) \\cdot \\text{Pr}(G).", blockquote=True) }}

Since there is only an 80% chance of correct identification, we know that
{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB \\, | \\, G) = 0.2") }} (the probability of
misidentifying a Green cab as Blue). We also know that 85% of the cabs are
Green hence we can plug these in (along with numbers already computed) to get

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(IDB) = 0.8 \\cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \\cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.", blockquote=True) }}

Putting it all together we get our answer

{{ get_latex_img("\\text{Pr}(B \\, | \\, IDB) = \\frac{\\text{Pr}(B \\text{ and } IDB \\text{ both occur})}{\\text{Pr}(IDB)} = \\frac{0.12}{0.29} \\approx 0.413793103.", blockquote=True) }}

Fantastic! Now we can get back to reading...
