In order to learn a bit more about how both the TCP and HTTP/2 protocols work,
I recently created the `tcp-h2-describe` [reverse proxy][1] in Python. I was
excited about some of the insights I was able to glean from the process, in
particular a full [example][2] tracing a connection between a gRPC client and
server over HTTP/2.

When a serialized [protobuf][6] comes across the wire as an HTTP/2
[DATA frame][5], the `tcp-h2-describe` proxy is able to give a faithful
description of the frame:

```
...
----------------------------------------
Frame Length = 21 (00 00 15)
Frame Type = DATA (00)
Flags = END_STREAM:0x1 (01)
Stream Identifier = 3 (00 00 00 03)
gRPC Compressed Flag = 0 (00)
Protobuf Length = 16 (00 00 00 10)
Protobuf Message (users.v1.User) =
   first_name: "Alice"
   last_name: "Redmond"
Hexdump (Protobuf Message) =
   0a 05 41 6c 69 63 65 12 07 52 65 64 6d 6f 6e 64
----------------------------------------
...
```

In addition to decoding the data frame and providing a "pretty" description of
the deserialized `users.v1.User` coming across the wire, this also preserves
the raw bytes being sent as part of the larger TCP packet data. For example
in `... 6c 69 63 ...` the `69` (`0x69` in hexadecimal is `105` in decimal)
corresponds to the ASCII encoding of the `i` in Alice.

### Why? {#why}

When I excitedly told my [CTO][3] Eugene "look what I built", he quickly said
"is this like [Wireshark][4]?" and he hit the nail on the head. So why did I
build something **much less** capable than Wireshark? Well the first answer to
that question is something like "Oops".

It gets even better: I originally went down the path of implementing this
myself because of a silly [mistake][7]. I was working on a Kubernetes service
running a gRPC server (more on that in a moment) and failed to get
off-the-shelf reverse proxies working. I tried seven different ([e.g.][8])
existing proxies of varying quality (some were just in GitHub gists) but
all of them failed to actually do anything at all within the container. The
problem: I kept binding the proxy to loopback IP (i.e. `localhost` or
`127.0.0.1`) rather than the broadcast IP (`0.0.0.0`).

In the end though I'm better for not having been "able" to use off-the-shelf
reverse proxies because I got to learn more about the guts of TCP (which I
use all the time) and HTTP/2 (which is new to me).

### Where? {#where}

As for where this code is running, I mentioned I'd say a bit more about the
Kubernetes service running a gRPC server. I'm currently doing some
discovery[ref]Many thanks to [Alex Fish][21] for being my sounding board during
this process[/ref] on gRPC patterns; I'm trying to understand if gRPC can work
for me and possibly my team or other groups at [Blend][9].

Within our infrastructure, I had a Kubernetes pod handling raw TCP traffic on
a port of my choosing. Unfortunately the AWS ELB[ref]To my
former Google Cloud colleagues, yes I use AWS every day[/ref] uses the
[proxy protocol][11] to add a prefix to the packet data from the first TCP
segment. This prefix gives information about the proxied IP for raw TCP
connections that may not be able to convey[ref]This is in contrast to HTTP,
where the `X-Forwarded-For` header is commonly used to indicate a proxy[/ref]
such information, e.g.

```
PROXY TCP4 198.51.100.22 203.0.113.7 35646 80
```

Due to my loopback IP vs. broadcast IP mixup, I wasn't able to get our
`proxyprotocol` [package][10] working with the `google/tcpproxy` [package][8].
Without a reverse proxy that could strip the prefix from the TCP packet
data, my gRPC server could not handle the request. So I set off to understand
TCP a little bit better and write my own reverse proxy that could strip the
proxy protocol prefix.

### What? {#what}

The `tcp-h2-describe` reverse proxy directs HTTP/2 traffic[ref]For now, this
only supports unencrypted traffic, though it is possible to use TLS in such a
proxy if the proxy is able to share the certs of the server being proxied[/ref]
from a client to a server:

```
$ tcp-h2-describe --server-host website.invalid --server-port 80
Starting tcp-h2-describe proxy server on port 24909
  Proxying server located at website.invalid:80
...
```

Once a request is sent through, the TCP packet data is parsed as a series of
HTTP/2 [frames][15] and each byte in the data is accounted for.

In the HTTP [example][16] provided in the library's documentation, proxied
traffic is sent to a locally running HTTP/2 server. The packet data from the
first TCP segment sent by the client contains 84 bytes:

```
00000000  50 52 49 20 2a 20 48 54  54 50 2f 32 2e 30 0d 0a  |PRI * HTTP/2.0..|
00000010  0d 0a 53 4d 0d 0a 0d 0a  00 00 24 04 00 00 00 00  |..SM......$.....|
00000020  00 00 01 00 00 10 00 00  02 00 00 00 01 00 04 00  |................|
00000030  00 ff ff 00 05 00 00 40  00 00 03 00 00 00 64 00  |.......@......d.|
00000040  06 00 01 00 00 00 00 06  04 00 00 00 00 00 00 02  |................|
00000050  00 00 00 00                                       |....|
00000054
```

We can see most of these bytes are not printable characters, however
`tcp-h2-describe` breaks this TCP packet data down and explains how every
single byte is used:

```
...
============================================================
client(127.0.0.1:59600)->proxy->server(localhost:8080)

Client Connection Preface = b'PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n'
Hexdump (Client Connection Preface) =
   50 52 49 20 2a 20 48 54 54 50 2f 32 2e 30 0d 0a
   0d 0a 53 4d 0d 0a 0d 0a
----------------------------------------
Frame Length = 36 (00 00 24)
Frame Type = SETTINGS (04)
Flags = UNSET (00)
Stream Identifier = 0 (00 00 00 00)
Settings =
   SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE:0x1 -> 4096 (00 01 | 00 00 10 00)
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH:0x2 -> 1 (00 02 | 00 00 00 01)
   SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE:0x4 -> 65535 (00 04 | 00 00 ff ff)
   SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE:0x5 -> 16384 (00 05 | 00 00 40 00)
   SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS:0x3 -> 100 (00 03 | 00 00 00 64)
   SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE:0x6 -> 65536 (00 06 | 00 01 00 00)
----------------------------------------
Frame Length = 6 (00 00 06)
Frame Type = SETTINGS (04)
Flags = UNSET (00)
Stream Identifier = 0 (00 00 00 00)
Settings =
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH:0x2 -> 0 (00 02 | 00 00 00 00)
----------------------------------------
...
```

### Go Deeper? {#go-deeper}

I was eventually able to handle the proxy protocol line that gets prepended by
the AWS ELB (see an [example][19]). In order to handle proxy protocol and
regular TCP connections the same way I had to [use][20] `MSG_PEEK` to avoid
reading bytes I didn't want to use while handling the proxy protocol
prefix[ref]Hat tip to [Will Charczuk][18] for the `proxyprotocol`
[package][10], which I used as a basis[/ref].

I did read a bit about going [deep enough][12] in the stack to actually
construct a TCP packet, but luckily I was able to avoid having to deal with
[TCP segment structure][13]

<div markdown="1" style="text-align: center;">
  ![TCP Packet](/images/tcp-packet.png)
</div>

and was just able to focus on the TCP package data. This is because the
`socket` [module][14] in Python's standard library provides a very nice
interface intended to emulate the

> Unix system call and library interface for sockets

In particular it allows focusing on the data within a TCP packet via
`recv()` and `send()`.

Once I got a handle on this process I was able to implement a reverse proxy
that opens **two** sockets: one for the client making a TCP request to the
proxy and one for the server being proxied. It simultaneously calls `recv()`
and `send()` on each socket, making sure to act as a trampoline that sends data
between the client and the server. For example, any data returned from a
`recv()` and server socket immediately gets passed to `send()` on the client
socket.

Since the data is "in the middle" while the proxy hands it from one socket
to another, the proxy can decode the series of HTTP/2 frames contained in
the data and print the findings to the console.
