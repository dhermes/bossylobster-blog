ALTERNATE TITLE: "Hard Work Is Not"

There is no such thing as hard work and I'm sick of hearing
about it.

For the purposes of this post (pronouns are hard), let's imagine "Jeff"
is interviewing for a job. He claims to a "hard worker". Unfortunately
for Jeff, he has made an ambiguous statement that typically indicates one
of a few possible translations

- I continue to work when I [hate it](#hate-it). (bad)
- I have no substantial way to [differentiate](#not-different) my contributions. (bad)
- I am very [productive](#productive). (good)
- I am not **lazy**. (WAT?)
- I do work that is hard. (still ambiguous)
- I go above the call of duty. (very good)

Let's cover each of them to help Jeff be certain what he means.

## I continue to work when I hate it {#hate-it}

If this is really the meaning, saying nothing would have been better.
Unless I am hiring Jeff to gouge his eyes out, I don't want him to even
imagine that he may hate his work.

If the idea of job-hate has set in, it is time for Jeff to
find a new (preferably enjoyable) profession.

## I have no substantial way to differentiate my contributions. {#not-different}

Jeff, buddy, if you have nothing to say, you need to go back to the
drawing board and prepare for this interview.

If you legitimately think your empty-calorie statement is clever,
think again. Unfortunately (for Jeff) over half of the people we've
interviewed have also delivered the news that they are hard
working. (This is also quite unfortunate for us; we've had to eliminate
over half of our candidates.)

## I am very productive. {#productive}

Let me be very clear, Jeff. Barring any personality or fit issues,
your productivity will be the deciding factor in this hiring
decision.

The work you deliver (no matter how hard or soft) and the frequency
of said delivery are what makes you "worth the money".

The great thing is: achieving a high-level of productivity does not
require looking like a "hard worker". In fact, for many of the most
skilled practitioners, most tasks appear to take no effort at all.

So Jeff, here's a piece of advice. Instead of making me guess what
you meant by telling me you're a hard worker, just tell me about
your productivity.
