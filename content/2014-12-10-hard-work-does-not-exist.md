ALTERNATE TITLE: "Hard Work Is Not"

There is no such thing as hard work.

For the purposes of this post, let's imagine a hypothetical person. **Jeff**
calls himself a **hard worker**. He describes himself in this way to
friends, family and job interviewers.

Unfortunately for Jeff, his claim of hardworking-ness is extremely
ambiguous. He has now left it up to the listener to determine if he
meant:

- I continue to work when I [hate it](#hate-it).
- I have no way to [differentiate](#not-different) my contributions.
- I am very [productive](#productive).
- I am not **lazy**.
- I do work that is hard.
- I go above the call of duty.

Let's cover each of them to help Jeff be certain what he means.

## I continue to work when I hate it {#hate-it}

If this is really the meaning, saying nothing would have been better.
Unless Jeff is being hired to gouge his eyes out, even hinting that
he may hate his work is a red flag.

If the idea of job-hate has set in, it is time for Jeff to
find a new (preferably enjoyable) profession.

## I have no way to differentiate my contributions {#not-different}

Jeff, buddy, if you have nothing to say, you need to go back to the
drawing board and prepare for your interviews.

If you legitimately think your empty-calorie statement is clever,
think again. Unfortunately (for Jeff) over half of the people
interviewed have also delivered the news that they are hardworking.
(This is also quite unfortunate for the company hiring; they've had to
eliminate over half of the candidates.)

## I am very productive {#productive}

Let me be very clear, Jeff. Barring any personality or fit issues,
your productivity will be the deciding factor in a hiring
decision.

The work you deliver (no matter how hard or soft) and the frequency
of said delivery are what makes you **worth the money**.

The great thing is: achieving a high-level of productivity does not
require looking like a **hard worker**. In fact, for many of the most
skilled practitioners, most tasks appear to take no effort at all.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

So Jeff, here's a piece of advice. Instead of making me guess what
you meant by telling me you're a hard worker, just tell me about
your productivity.
