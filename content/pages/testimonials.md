* Danny manages to be relaxed, funny, and watchable AND very knowledgeable
  about the material AND a stickler about teaching it AND good at explaining it
  clearly and quickly. This is a combination of strengths so rare around here
  that I thought it was mythical.

* Danny is highly prepared, available, and helpful. His jokes kept the class
  entertained, while his coding kept the class engaged. Moreover, his anecdotes
  about numerical analysis showed the class that he had genuine interest in
  the subject. (**Student, UC Berkeley Math 128A, Spring 2017**)
* He's prepared, willing to answer questions, frank (a good kind of frank), and
  knowledgeable. I particularly enjoy the way he incorporates practical
  examples and presents interpretations of the concepts, most of lecture was
  derivations, so Danny's practical examples helped ground things, and his
  interpretations were a boon to understand the often boring and complex
  derivations that we were presented during class.
