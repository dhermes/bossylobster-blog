My name is Danny Hermes. I am a bit of a mix between a mathematician and
a software engineer, but either way I really enjoy problem solving.
After graduating from the University of Michigan[ref]Go Blue![/ref] in 2010, I
bounced from a startup to Google. At Google, I spent almost 3 years at Google
as a Developer Programs Engineer. In the 5 years that followed, I
completed[ref]August 2018[/ref] a PhD in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley.

I enjoy spending time with my family, coding (usually in Python), amateur
wrestling, MMA, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and following Michigan's basketball
and wrestling teams.

Thanks for visiting my blog!
