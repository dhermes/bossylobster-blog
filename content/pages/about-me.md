My name is Danny Hermes. I am a bit of a mix between a mathematician and a
software engineer, but either way I really enjoy thinking about hard problems. I
am currently having a **phenomenal** time as Co-founder & CTO at [Hardfin][2].

I am passionate about building high quality software. I am focused on tools that
eliminate toil and create delight to maximize productivity in engineering
organizations. I thoroughly enjoy programming and problem solving: thinking at
the abstraction level of a function, a file, a package, a service or a system
are all very rewarding. I deeply value communication as a software engineering
discipline, which comes in the form of programming interfaces, documentation,
code review comments and design documents to name a few.

Throughout my education and career I've gained deep expertise in cloud
computing, developer tools, distributed systems, scientific computing and
applied mathematics. As a software engineer, I've invested in learning my tools
and the idioms of the surrounding developer communities.

I enjoy spending time with my family, coding (usually in Go or Python), amateur
wrestling, MMA, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and following Michigan's basketball
and wrestling teams.

Thanks for visiting my blog! In addition to my personal blog I also write on the
[Hardfin Engineering blog][3].
