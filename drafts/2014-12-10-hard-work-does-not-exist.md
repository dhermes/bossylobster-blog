Let's imagine a hypothetical person. **Jeff**
calls himself a **hard worker**. He describes himself in this way to
friends, family and job interviewers.

Jeff, along with many other people, is worried that he may be mistaken
for a medium or soft worker. But if a majority of people are hard
workers, aren't they just workers?

Unfortunately for Jeff, in addition to being immune to self-description,
hardworking-ness is extremely ambiguous. He has now left it up to the
listener to determine if he meant:

- I am [not](#lazy) lazy.
- I do work that [is](#work-is-hard) hard.
- I continue to work when I [hate it](#hate-it).
- I have no way to [differentiate](#not-different) myself.
- I do [a lot](#a-lot) of work.
- I go [above](#above) the job description.
- I am very [productive](#productive).

Let's cover each of them to help Jeff be certain what he means.

## I am not lazy {#lazy}

This is at best a neutral statement. Let's hope this isn't what Jeff meant.
Non-laziness is setting the bar extremely low.

## I do work that is hard {#work-is-hard}

In the case that Jeff is addressing an interviewer rather than an
acquaintance, performing difficult tasks is a plus. However,
since an interviewer determines the job specifications, pointing out
that the work is hard is not surprising or novel.

Among friends and family this can easily come off as arrogance or
condescension. The implication being that Jeff thinks his work is
hard **relative** to the work of others.

As a friend of Jeff, you might think he's saying:

- You are lazy.
- You take your success for granted and I have to earn mine.
- My work is more challenging or more important than yours.

## I continue to work when I hate it {#hate-it}

If this is really the meaning, saying nothing would have been better.
Unless Jeff is being hired to gouge his eyes out, even hinting that
he may hate his work is a red flag.

If the idea of job-hate has set in, it is time for Jeff to
find a new (preferably enjoyable) profession.

## I have no way to differentiate myself {#not-different}

Jeff, buddy, if you have nothing to say, you need to go back to the
drawing board and prepare for your interviews.

If you legitimately think your empty-calorie statement is clever,
think again. Unfortunately (for Jeff) over half of the people
interviewed have also delivered the news that they are hardworking.
(This is also quite unfortunate for the company hiring; they've had to
eliminate over half of the candidates.)

## I do a lot of work {#a-lot}

Examples of hard work that is stupid: using the wrong tool for the job.

For example, manually adding numbers instead of using a spreadsheet
or programming.

Somewhat related to the [Dunning-Kruger][1] effect in that someone
can perceive their work as being worthwhile if they are not an expert.

## I go above the job description {#above}

This is the flip-side of [non-laziness](#lazy).

## I am very productive {#productive}

Let me be very clear. Barring any personality or fit issues,
Jeff's productivity will be the deciding factor in a hiring
decision.

The work he delivers (no matter how hard or soft) and the frequency
of said delivery are what makes him **worth the money**.

The great thing is: achieving a high-level of productivity does not
require looking like a **hard worker**. In fact, for many of the most
skilled practitioners, most tasks appear to take no effort at all.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

So Jeff, here's a piece of advice. Instead of making me guess what
you meant by telling me you're a hard worker, just tell me about
your productivity.
